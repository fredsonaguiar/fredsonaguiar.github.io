I’m a Brazilian student currently pursuing a Master Degree in Applied Mathematics and Data Science at the School of Applied Mathematics of Getulio Vargas Foundation (Brazil), carrying out studies on Optimal Control Theory. My main focus are applications on Mathematical Epidemiology and Machine Learning. See my recent work on [MPC and LSTM Observers for Epidemic Mitigation](https://fredsonaguiar.github.io/assets/pdf/Paper[691]-File[1].pdf) presented as poster in the [XLIII CNMAC](https://www.cnmac.org.br/novo/index.php/CNMAC/ano/2024/). See also my [OC for Safe RL Review Essay (prelimindary)](https://fredsonaguiar.github.io/assets/pdf/OC_AI_Safety_Overview_Essay.pdf) and my [Case Study on IOC and MPC for Adaptive Autonomous Moving (prelimindary)](https://fredsonaguiar.github.io/assets/pdf/IOC_MPC_Timely_Distributional_Change.pdf) for a sample idea of the area.

In 2022, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from the same institution, after developing research in the areas of Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Representation, Ontologies and Textual Inference. See the [OpenWordnet-PT repository](https://github.com/own-pt/openWordnet-PT) alongside with [this paper](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/OASIcs.LDK.2021.21), and the [delphin-rdf python plugin](https://github.com/own-pt/delphin-rdf), for references.

I seek the deepening of technical and personal skills through the studies and discussion of topics related to mathematics, research and education, by participating and sharing in academic events, groups and studies. I'm also early searching for **PhD Positions** in my areas of interest. Research interests include:

- Mathematical Epidemiology
- Machine Learning (ML)
- Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- Optimal Control Theory (OC)
- Model Predictive Control (MPC)
