I’m a Brazilian student currently pursuing a Master Degree in Mathematical Modeling at the School of Applied Mathematics of Getulio Vargas Foundation (Brazil), carrying out studies on Optimal Control problems associated with Reinforcement Learning methods, including topics of Learning Based Model Predictive Control (MPC). See my [RL+OC repository](https://github.com/FredsoNerd/reinforcement_learning_and_optimal_control) and my [paper discussion project repository](https://github.com/FredsoNerd/bang_bang_mountain_car) for a sample idea of the area.


In 2022, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from the same institution, after developing research in the areas of Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Representation, Ontologies and Textual Inference. See the [OpenWordnet-PT repository](https://github.com/own-pt/openWordnet-PT) alongside with [this paper](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/OASIcs.LDK.2021.21), and the [delphin-rdf python plugin](https://github.com/own-pt/delphin-rdf), for references.


I seek the deepening of technical and personal skills through the studies and discussion of topics related to mathematics, research and education, by participating and sharing in academic events, groups and studies. I'm also early searching for **PhD Positions** in my areas of interest. Research interests include:

 * Optimal Control Theory (OC)
 * Reinforcement Learning (RL)
 * Learning-Based Model Predictive Control (MPC)
