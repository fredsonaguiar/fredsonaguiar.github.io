I'm presenting a poster in the [CNMAC 2024](https://www.cnmac.org.br/novo/index.php/CNMAC/ano/2024/) in Porto de Galinhas, Brazil! The event holds from the *nov 16th* to the *nov 20th*. My work will be presented under the title: A Learning-Based Model Predictive Control Framework with an State Observer for Epidemic Mitigation.
